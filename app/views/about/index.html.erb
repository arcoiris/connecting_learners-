<!-- You've decided to take up formal logic. (You heard it's all the rave amongst philosphers) You're done with college (or never went) and want to learn on your own. Taking the next step, you sign up for an online course. All goes well, until you hit a particular section.

You come here and find someone to talk to about your endeavor.  -->
